## What is MCP?

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) is an open standard that lets AI tools access external data sources in real-time.

With MCP, your AI assistant can fetch the latest better-styled documentation directly, without you needing to copy/paste.

## Claude Code

The easiest way to add better-styled docs to Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add better-styled https://better-styled.com --transport sse
```

That's it! Claude Code now has access to the full documentation.

### Manual Configuration

Or add to your project's `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "better-styled": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@anthropic-ai/mcp-server-fetch",
        "https://better-styled.com"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    File location: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "better-styled": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "-y",
            "@anthropic-ai/mcp-server-fetch",
            "https://better-styled.com"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    File location: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "better-styled": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "-y",
            "@anthropic-ai/mcp-server-fetch",
            "https://better-styled.com"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Restart Claude Desktop after making changes.

## Cursor

In Cursor settings, navigate to **Features → MCP Servers** and add:

```
https://better-styled.com
```

## Verifying the Connection

After setup, ask your AI assistant:

```
What is better-styled and how do I create a Button component?
```

If configured correctly, it will fetch the documentation and provide accurate answers.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="MCP server not connecting">
    1. Ensure you have Node.js installed
    2. Check that npx is in your PATH
    3. Try running the command manually: `npx -y @anthropic-ai/mcp-server-fetch https://better-styled.com`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Outdated information">
    MCP fetches documentation in real-time, so it should always be current. If you see outdated info, try restarting your AI tool.
