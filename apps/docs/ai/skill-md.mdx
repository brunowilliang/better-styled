## What is skill.md?

A machine-readable capability file following the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) specification. It tells AI agents:

- **What** better-styled can do
- **When** to use it
- **How** to generate correct code

```
https://better-styled.com/skill.md
```

## Why skill.md?

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| llms.txt | Directory - where to find information |
| skill.md | Capability summary - what actions are possible |

AI agents process skill.md to understand your product's capabilities before taking actions.

## What's Inside

The skill.md includes:

    - Compound components with slots
    - React Native with NativeWind/Uniwind
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Core API Examples">
    Complete code examples for:
    - `styled()` - creating components
    - `createStyledContext()` - variant propagation
    - `withSlots()` - compound components
    - Utility functions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Code Patterns">
    Rules for generating correct code:
    - Use arrow functions (not React.FC)

## Using skill.md

### With AI Assistants

Reference it in your prompts:

```
Use the skill.md at https://better-styled.com/skill.md
to create a Button component with size variants.
```

### With Cursor / Copilot

Add to `.cursorrules` or `.github/copilot-instructions.md`:

```markdown
When working with better-styled:

1. Import from "better-styled"
2. Use styled() for creating components
3. Use createStyledContext() for variant propagation
4. Use withSlots() for compound components
5. Never use React.FC - use arrow functions
6. Types are inferred automatically - don't add manual types

Reference: https://better-styled.com/skill.md
```

### With Context7

better-styled is indexed by [Context7](https://context7.com), allowing AI tools to fetch up-to-date documentation automatically.

```

## Tips for AI Assistants

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Always use context for parent-child relationships">
    When components have children that should inherit variants (like Button with Icon), use `createStyledContext()`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Prefer slots over separate exports">
    Instead of exporting `CardRoot`, `CardHeader`, `CardBody` separately, use `withSlots()` to create `Card.Header`, `Card.Body`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Don't add unnecessary types">
    TypeScript infers variant types automatically. Don't add manual type annotations unless needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use arrow functions for components">
    ```tsx
    // Correct
    const Button = ({ children }: ButtonProps) => { ... }

    // Incorrect
    const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ children }) => { ... }
    ```
  </Accordion>
