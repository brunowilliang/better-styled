## Requirements

- ⚛️ React 18+ or React Native
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS (required)
- 📘 TypeScript 5.0+ (recommended)

## Tailwind CSS Setup

better-styled uses `className` for styling. You need Tailwind CSS configured in your project.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Web (React)">
    Follow the [Tailwind CSS installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) for your framework (Next.js, Vite, etc.).
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="React Native">
    You need a Tailwind-to-StyleSheet solution:

    - [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/) - Tailwind CSS utilities for React Native
    - [Uniwind](https://uniwind.dev/) - High-performance Tailwind bindings for React Native

    Follow their installation guides first.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## That's it ✨

✅ No extra configuration. No providers to wrap. No build plugins.

Just import and use:

```tsx
import { styled } from "better-styled";
```

## Smart Class Merging

better-styled uses `tailwind-merge` under the hood to handle class conflicts intelligently:

```tsx
const Button = styled("button", {
  base: { className: "px-4 py-2 rounded" },
  variants: {
    size: {
      sm: { className: "px-2 py-1 text-sm" },  // overrides px-4 py-2
      lg: { className: "px-6 py-3 text-lg" },  // overrides px-4 py-2
    },
  },
});
```
